4.Do you agree with the views expressed, especially in light of the 'energy crisis' experienced worldwide in 2022?
I'm not agree with energy crisis because developed countries like America and Norway and… countries are trying to save energy as much as possible also the world is going use Renewable energies like solar energy instead of Non-renewable resource like petrol then there will be no problem in near feature if undeveloped countries like China and India and… stop what they are doing to this world also we should stop making babies like this cause this world doesn't have much more space for more population best solution is at most having one or two babies and with these things most of the problems of  our world like energy crisis will be solved fast and easy.
